title: Plyr 1.7
subtitle: Changes in this version
---

* `rbind.fill`: if a column contains both factors and characters (in different
  inputs), the resulting column will be coerced to character

* When there are more than 2^31 distinct combinations `id`, switches to a
  slower fallback strategy using strings (inspired by `merge`) that guarantees
  correct results. This fixes problems with `join` when joining across many
  columns. (Fixes #63)

* `split_indices` checks input more aggressively to prevent segfaults. 
   Fixes #43.

* fix small bug in `loop_apply` which lead to segfaults in certain
  circumstances. (Thanks to PÃ¥l Westermark for patch)

* `itertools` and `iterators` moved to suggests from imports so that plyr now
  only depends on base R.
