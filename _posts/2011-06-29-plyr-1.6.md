title: Plyr 1.6
---

* documentation improved using new features of `roxygen2`

* fixed namespacing issue which lead to lost labels when subsetting the
  results of `*lply`

* `colwise` automatically strips off split variables.

* `rlply` now correctly deals with `rlply(4, NULL)` (thanks to bug report from
  Eric Goldlust)

* `rbind.fill` tries harder to keep attributes, retaining the attributes from
  the first occurrence of each column it finds. It also now works with
  variables of class `POSIXlt` and preserves the ordered status of factors.

* `arrange` now works with one column data frames
